 <p>Hi, this is me getting back into coding after a couple months of recovering from being burnt out. This field of study
    is no joke. I really needed a break and I had to trust myself that i'd find my way back to being enthusiastic about coding. Surley im getting there.
    I'm tackling these old labs in hopes that I can truly understadn the content and work, and not just trying to meet a deadline with genric
    efforts. I want to see passion behind my work and efforts this time around. Nov 30, 2023.
